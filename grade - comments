1 – Your header file does not have the instance methods that you need.  I needed to uncomment your apparent method section, add return types, and rename some.

2 – Your isEven and other isSomething methods should have a Boolean return type, not print out an answer.

3 – Your isPrime method does not work.  You need to stop as soon as you detect it is divisible by number.

4 – in isPerfectSquare use break instead of i = num;

5 – Use more explanatory variable names

6 – Your nearestPerfectSquare does not work.  It should be much simpler.  Just start at the number and work your way down until you find a perfect square.  Nearest perfect square could call an isPerfectSquare method
